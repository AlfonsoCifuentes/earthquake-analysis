# 🌍 **Earthquake Analysis and Prediction** 🌋

---

## 📖 **Overview**

*Welcome to* **earthquake-analysis**, *a project dedicated to* **analyzing and predicting earthquakes** *through advanced* ***data science*** *and* ***artificial intelligence*** *techniques*.  
Our goal is to **explore seismic data**, perform **deep analysis** and build **predictive models** to anticipate the occurrence and magnitude of future earthquakes.

---

## ✨ **Key Features**

- 🧹 **Cleaning and preprocessing** of historical seismic data.
- 📊 **Exploratory data analysis** (EDA) with interactive visualizations.
- 🤖 **Machine learning models** for earthquake prediction.
- 🏆 **Rigorous evaluation** of model performance.
- 📓 **Documented notebooks** and reproducible scripts.
- 📈 **Graphics and visualizations** to facilitate interpretation.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Streamlit application** for real-time data exploration.
